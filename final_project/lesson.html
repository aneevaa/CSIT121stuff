        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This course has taught me a lot. From the basics of coding to web design, it has provided me with a solid foundation. I am very thankful to the professor because she helped me a lot throughout the course. The instructions and projects were clear, and whenever I needed help, she was there to guide me.</p>
        <p>One of the challenges I faced was that, since this was my first coding class, I struggled a bit at the beginning. However, with the help of the instructions provided, I was able to catch up quickly.</p>
