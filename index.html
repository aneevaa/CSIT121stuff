        <p>My first Website. At first it looked very complicated but as I looked through it and break down the tags then I started to understand the terms.</p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>1. I learned to code on VS Code. </p>
        <p>2. I learned to put link to into my code.</p>
        <p>3. learned to use heading tags.</p>

        <p>Learning about HTML helped me design my own websites. I can recognize the tags and understand the meaning of the tags. </p>
